<p id="introText">If you're here, you're probably wondering why this website exists.</p>
<p id="introText">"York Auctions" is a fake online shopping website made with the purpose of demonstrating a rudementary bot designed to instantly snipe an online shopping listing, called "Snipema".</p>
<p id="introText">To properly show off the bot, this website uses cookies to make an artificial 10 second timer, and when the timer runs out, the autograph will show as out of stock when you finish putting in all your info.</p>
<p id="introText">No information is sent to me, I suggest you input random payment info as anything that could theoretically be a valid payment method will be accepted.</p>
<p id="introText">If youre interested, you can find the github project for both this website and the snipema bot at https://github.com/vanssx3/Snipema</p>
<p id="introText">By the way, you can find login info to log into the site in the "york.js" file ;)</p>
